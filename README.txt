# MazePy: A competitive educational maze game for Python

## Description

MazePy is game-based learning system developed as part of Ameel Valjee and Calvin Nyoni's Honours Project for the University of Cape Town.
The system aims to use gamification through a maze style game and the injection to induce motivation and engagement in students.
The game was developed over 6 weeks (and has room for improvement) using PyGame and runs on any OS which supports Python.

## Usage

In the desired directory where MazePy is stored

2) Run an instance of MazePy by 'python main.py' in the terminal #starts an instance of MazePy (you can run as many instances on this machine or other machines to connect to the server)
